## Prerequisites

Before setting up the Laravel project, ensure that you have the following software installed on your machine:

- PHP (>= 7.4)
- Composer
- MySQL (or any other supported database)
- Laravel CLI

## Installation

To install the Laravel app, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

   git clone <repository_url>

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   cd restaurant-delivery-api

3. Install the dependencies using Composer:

   composer install

## Configuration

The Laravel app requires some configuration settings to run correctly. Here's what you need to do:

1. Copy the `.env.example` file and rename it to `.env`:

   cp .env.example .env

2. Generate an application key:

   php artisan key:generate

   This will set the `APP_KEY` value in your `.env` file.

3. Configure your database settings in the `.env` file:

   DB_CONNECTION=mysql
   DB_HOST=127.0.0.1
   DB_PORT=3306
   DB_DATABASE=your_database
   DB_USERNAME=your_username
   DB_PASSWORD=your_password

   Replace `your_database`, `your_username`, and `your_password` with your actual database credentials.

## Database Setup

To set up the database for your Laravel app, follow these steps:

1. Create a new database in your MySQL server (or any other supported database).

2. Migrate the database tables:

   php artisan migrate

   This will create the necessary tables in your database.

## Running the Application

To run the Laravel app locally, use the following command:

php artisan serve

This will start a local development server at `http://127.0.0.1:8000`. You can access the API endpoints using this URL.

## API Documentation
